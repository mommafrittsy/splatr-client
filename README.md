# Web Client 

Splatr is a platform for artists to market their commission offerings with security and confidence throughout the entire commission lifecycle. This repo will build the web app that most users will interact with.

## To Do

Not exactly a roadmap, but here's my collection of ideas, hopes, and dreams for where the client will go.
- [ ] Register Users
- [ ] Convert User to Artist
- [ ] Artist Commission workflow
- [ ] Artist public gallery
- [ ] Fine-grained authorization model
